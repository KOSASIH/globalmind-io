# GlobalMind.io

A cutting-edge platform for augmented reality and quantum computing

## Introduction

GlobalMind.io is a revolutionary platform that combines the power of augmented reality (AR) and quantum computing to create a new generation of innovative applications. Our platform provides a seamless integration of AR.js, A-Frame, and Qiskit, enabling developers to build complex AR experiences and quantum algorithms with ease.

## Features

* **Augmented Reality**: Leverage the power of AR.js and A-Frame to create immersive AR experiences
* **Quantum Computing**: Utilize Qiskit to develop and execute quantum algorithms on real quantum hardware
* **Node.js Integration**: Seamlessly integrate AR and quantum computing with Node.js and Express.js
* **Advanced Tooling**: Take advantage of modern tooling, including Jest, ESLint, and Webpack
